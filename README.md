Tools for structuring, processing and encoding things for the nostr protocol.

This covers almost everything found in
[go-nostr](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/go-nostr) except rewritten in fully
idiomatic Go and
restructured for better readability and organisation for a more friendly
developer experience.

[nostr-sdk](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/nostr-sdk) is also included as it 
contains useful tools for client developers.
